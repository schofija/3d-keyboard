This is my final project for CS450 Fall 2021.

I do not include all the files needed to run this program.

A visual studio solution with all needed additional files can be found here:

http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs450/Sample2019.zip

Copy all of the files in this repo into the SampleFreeGlut2019 folder.

glslprogram.cpp will needed to be added as a source file in VS
(Right click 'Source Files' -> Add -> Existing Item)
